# Arithmetic_progression

## What is it ?

A simple python script used to complete a [challenge](https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Programmation/Suite-arithmetique) on root-me. The purpose was to calculate the nth term of an arithmetic progression in less than two 2 seconds

## Running
 `python3 arithmetic_progression.py` 

The project was built on python 3. 

## Common errors 

Please be aware that the script doesn't calculate all the nth terms in 2 seconds, so if you got the error `Time out !` on your terminal just relaunch the script until it calculates the nth term in less than 2 seconds. The flag should be printed on your terminal and you must be logged on on root-me.
